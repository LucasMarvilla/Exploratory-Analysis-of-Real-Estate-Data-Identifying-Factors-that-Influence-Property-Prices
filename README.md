In this project, an exploratory analysis of real estate market data was performed using Python and the pandas library. The main focus was to identify which variables most influence property prices. The dataset columns were inspected, the data types were analyzed, and then the correlations between the numerical variables and the price were calculated. The analysis revealed that the variables most positively correlated with price are: sqft_living (built area), grade (quality of the property), sqft_above (area above ground), and bathrooms. Variables such as zipcode, long, and condition showed a low correlation with price. This made it possible to understand which attributes have the greatest impact on property values, providing useful insights for assessments and decisions in the real estate sector.
